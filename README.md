# Simple GET BUSY App

The GET BUSY App is an app designed to help you keep track of all the tasks you need to get done. Get Busy!

## Functionality

Simply click 'add to do' and a pop up with a form asking you date and duty to be fulfilled will appear. Fill it out, click create and add it to the list of things to do!!

## Technology

For this app to function properly a system of form validation was used to verify the form was filled out correctly while also disabling buttons to submit to-do's upon resetting the form or initially opening a to-do form
